# City Simulation

This is my programming course final project. Specification of the project (in polish) can be 
found here: https://www.fuw.edu.pl/~kaste/pf2019/miasto.pdf

# How to use
To compile on linux just use command 
```
  bash compile.sh
```
or 
``` 
  chmod u+x compile.sh
  ./compile.sh
```

Whis will create executable *a.out* file which you can then run from the terminal using following command:
```
  ./a.out
```

This will prompt you with dialog from which you can run the simulation.

# Examples
Below is listed image of simulation of 1000 people after 15 years with city size of 12.5 units.

Program also supports .ppm file format, so you can save images in that format if you wish.
